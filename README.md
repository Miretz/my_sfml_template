# my_sfml_template

My cross-platform template for SFML projects

# My setup
I use [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with the following extensions:
- [Clangd](https://clangd.llvm.org/installation) - C++ code completion & highlighting
- [Clang-Format](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/ClangFormatStyleOptions.html) - Code auto formatting
- [CMake Tools](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.cmake-tools) - CMake project support for VSCode

Simply clone this repository and run the following commands from the command palette:
- ```CMake: Build``` - to build the executable
- ```CMake: Debug``` - to run the project in Debug mode (shortcut Ctrl+F5)

If all goes well, you should see the game in action.
Press ```Esc``` to exit.
