My cross-platform template for SFML projects

# My setup
I use [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with the following extensions:
- [Clangd](https://clangd.llvm.org/installation) - C++ code completion & highlighting
- [Clang-Format](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/ClangFormatStyleOptions.html) - Code formatting
- [CMake Tools](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.cmake-tools) - CMake project support for VSCode

After installing these extensions, simply clone this repository and open the folder in VSCode. CMake Tools should recognize the project.

Now you can use the following commands:
- ```CMake: Build``` - to build the executable (do this first)
- ```CMake: Run Without Debugging``` - to run the executable (shortcut Shift+F5)
- ```CMake: Debug``` - to run the project with debugging (shortcut Ctrl+F5)

If all goes well, you should see the game in action.
Press ```Esc``` to exit.
